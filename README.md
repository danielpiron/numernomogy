# numernomogy
_Numernomogy_ is a sloppy portmanteau that is meant to mean _"The Study of Number Name"_ _Numer_-_Nom_-_ogy_.

This project came about as a way to get a list of baby names whose letter values add up to a particular value.
The _values_ of names are calculated by enumerating the places of each letter of the name (A=1, B=2, C=3, etc.)
and adding these together. For example, the name Adam resolves to 19, (1 + 4 + 1 + 13 = 19).

To get a list of names, this project downloads from https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/names.zip

These files also contain the popularity of the names of people born in the US for the past 100 or so years.
